In the course Introduction to Computing, you've learned how to write code using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). In this lesson, we will be focusing on writing code in PHP programming language. To help you evaluate what you've learned and identify skills that need improvement there are self-assessment questions (SAQ) and Practice sets for every topic.

We will be using the tutorials made by Brad Traversy of Traversy media. He's famous for his video tutorials of different programming languages and technologies.

Using what you've learned in HTML and CSS, design **pages** for the following requirements (the objective is to practice writing CSS, using bootstrap is prohibited):<br /><br />
1. where user will input his / her personal information such as full name, address, contact number, and temperature at that moment<br />
2. login form where the admin will use to view the list of records<br />
3. where the admin can view the list of records entered using `<table>` add atleast 5 rows of sample data<br /><br />
Submission bin for this activity will be available in Canvas. Put all files related to this activity in folder named **YourLastname_P302** (e.g. Martinez_P302) |
